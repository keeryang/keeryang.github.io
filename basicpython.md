## Some lectures notes in python and in machine learning in finance.

I have been the TA for Machine Learning in Finance class taught by Professor [Murray Z. Frank](https://mzfrank.github.io/myweb/) at UMN. I taught some basic python in finance in the TA session. You can find some teaching material from Professor Frank's [website](https://mzfrank.github.io/myweb/) and from here.

[Introduction to Python](./papers/python_intro.ipynb)
This is the Jupyter file I used to teach students basic python; it includes commonly used commands to clean and describe the data. I also use it as a cheatsheet sometimes.
